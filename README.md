# Zoo-Dataset

# Description
This dataset consists of 101 animals from a zoo. There are 16 variables with various traits to describe the animals. The 7 Class Types are: Mammal, Bird, Reptile, Fish, Amphibian, Bug and Invertebrate

The purpose for this dataset is to be able to predict the classification of the animals, based upon the variables. It is the perfect dataset for those who are new to learning Machine Learning.
